Smart AI-Powered Security Camera 🚨📷

This is a smart surveillance system I developed with my team as part of our final year project. It uses a Raspberry Pi and Python (with OpenCV) to detect fire, faces, animals, and even number plates — and sends instant alerts through Telegram.

 What It Does

- 🔍 Detects faces using Haar cascades  
- 🔥 Identifies fire using image processing  
- 🐶 Detects animal movement  
- 🚗 Recognizes number plates using OCR  
- 📲 Sends real-time alerts through Telegram bot  
- 🖥️ Shows live camera feed on-screen

All this works in real time on a Raspberry Pi 4 with just a camera and some sensors!

🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascades, Tesseract OCR  
- Raspberry Pi 4, PiCamera  
- Telegram Bot API (via telepot)  
- YOLOv3 (for object detection)  
- Basic hardware: buzzer, IR sensor, jumper wires
